knee_step_test_PID_control_me.py -- Step-response test bench for tuning a
code-level PID position controller for the KNEE joint's actuator, driven
in the CubeMars driver's Servo CURRENT LOOP mode (Control Mode ID 1,
actuators.set_torque(), amperes -- Ch 14 S3.2 of the tutorial series).
"_me" = Magnetic Encoder (the AS5048B, not the motor's own internal one).

This is the knee counterpart of ankle_step_test_PID_control_me.py --
identical control law, structure, homing technique, guards, and plotting;
only the joint-specific settings below (CAN ID, magnetic-encoder address/
offset, hardware limits, step-signal convention) differ, per
leg_joint_specifications.txt's knee section.

PURPOSE
This script exists ONLY to tune KP, KI, KD for a code-level PID position
controller on the bench, using a classic step-response test: hold the
knee at a baseline angle, suddenly command a new target angle (the
"step"), and watch how the joint gets there. The KP/KI/KD values found
here are meant to be carried over, unchanged, into the full knee
gait-trajectory controllers later.

CONTROL LAW -- the PID equation lives here, in Python, not inside the
driver's own internal position loop (which is never used by this script).
Standard discrete-time textbook form, backward Euler on the error for D
and a forward/rectangular sum for I:

    error_deg[k]  = reference_deg[k] - actual_deg[k]
    integral      += error_deg[k] * dt                          (clamped, anti-windup)
    derivative     = (error_deg[k] - error_deg[k-1]) / dt

    current [A] = KP * error_deg[k] + KI * integral + KD * derivative

The PID's output IS the current sent straight to the motor driver's
Current Loop -- there is no separate torque-to-current conversion step.
KT is logged only, as an informational N*m estimate, and never enters the
control law.

NOTE ON DERIVATIVE KICK
Because the reference here is a literal step, error_deg[k]-error_deg[k-1]
contains one large, instantaneous jump at the exact tick the step
happens (the reference itself jumps there) -- so the D-term will show a
single large spike at that tick. That spike is an artifact of the step
TEST SIGNAL, not the plant -- expected, and part of why LOOP_HZ and
MAX_CURRENT_A exist as guards.

INPUT / FEEDBACK
actual_deg[k] comes ONLY from the knee's own external AS5048B magnetic
encoder (I2C) -- this script relies on the magnetic encoder alone; the
motor's internal encoder is never read, at all:

    actual_deg[k] = wrap_deg(magnetic_encoder_reading - MAGNETIC_ENCODER_OFFSET)

NO position filtering is applied -- actual_deg[k] is the raw (glitch-
guarded) reading, fed straight into the PID every tick, exactly as in
knee_ankle_trajectory_PID_control_me.py, so the gains tuned here carry
over to the trajectory controller unchanged. The glitch-jump guard
(GLITCH_JUMP_DEG) rejects an implausible single-tick jump and reuses the
last known-good reading.

SIGN CONVENTIONS -- two separate facts, kept identical to
knee_ankle_trajectory_PID_control_me.py
  - The encoder-to-angle convention is simply raw - OFFSET, wrapped (no
    MAGNETIC_ENCODER_SIGN). Knee: 0 deg = full extension, flexion NEGATIVE.
  - ENCODER_TO_MOTOR_SIGN: whether a positive commanded current/velocity
    moves actual_deg up or down. The PID's current and its P/I/D terms
    are multiplied by it right after the PID computes them, and the
    homing/hold velocity is multiplied by it too, so everything logged,
    printed and sent to the motor agrees. error_deg is a pure position
    quantity and is NOT flipped. Getting this wrong turns the P-term
    into positive feedback (a fast runaway) -- see its definition below.
  - DISPLAY_SIGN is cosmetic only: it flips the sign of the logged/
    plotted reference and actual angles (knee shown flexion-positive, as in the trajectory script) and never
    touches the control loop.

HOMING (velocity-mode-to-target)
Before the PID/current controller ever takes over, the joint is driven
to BASELINE_ANGLE_DEG -- the magnetic encoder's own offset-corrected
zero (actual_deg = 0, i.e. raw == MAGNETIC_ENCODER_OFFSET), which is
this leg's real mechanical full-extension position -- using the same
monitoring/stop technique as velocity_mode_to_target_magnetic_encoder.py
(Servo Velocity Loop Mode, actuators.set_velocity(), magnetic encoder
alone decides arrival, a burst of zero-velocity commands stops it), but
with one difference: since this script always homes to the SAME fixed
BASELINE_ANGLE_DEG every run, and the joint can start on either side of
it (e.g. the previous run ended at STEP_ANGLE_DEG, some degrees into
flexion), the DIRECTION of the commanded velocity is chosen
automatically every tick from the live error -- not a fixed, hand-
verified sign like the reference script uses. See home_joint() below.

HARD JOINT LIMITS -- NO TOLERANCE
KNEE_LIMIT_MIN_DEG / KNEE_LIMIT_MAX_DEG are enforced UNCONDITIONALLY,
every tick, both during homing and during the PID loop: the instant the
magnetic encoder's corrected reading is outside that range, the motor is
immediately zeroed and the script exits (see enforce_hard_limits()).
There is no margin and no grace period -- this is a hard safety rail,
not a soft guard.

TEST SEQUENCE -- the PID controller is NOT involved until step 3
  1. Home the joint (Velocity Loop Mode) to BASELINE_ANGLE_DEG --
     home_joint(), traveling at |HOMING_VELOCITY_RAD_S| with the
     direction chosen automatically from the live error every tick.
  2. Hold BASELINE_ANGLE_DEG for PRE_STEP_S seconds -- STILL Velocity
     Loop Mode, NOT the PID controller: a small bidirectional
     bang-bang hold (hold_baseline_velocity_mode()) keeps the joint at
     the baseline so the pre-step segment is a clean, controller-
     independent reference, not a demonstration of the (not yet tuned)
     PID holding still.
  3. Control HANDS OFF to the PID controller and the reference becomes
     STEP_ANGLE_DEG -- THE step -- held there for POST_STEP_S seconds
     under PID/current control. THIS INSTANT IS t=0 for all logging
     (see t0_pid below) -- the homing and pre-step hold phases above are
     NOT logged at all, so the CSV/plots start exactly at the step, not
     before it. The PID's integral and derivative state start
     completely fresh at this instant (no pre-loaded integral, no
     stale error).
  4. Motor released. Plots + a CSV of the logged data saved to
     results/step_test_knee/run_<N>/ next to this script (N increments
     automatically every run).

WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE WHEN YOU RUN IT
The motor wakes up, homes to BASELINE_ANGLE_DEG (full extension), holds
there (velocity-mode, not PID) for PRE_STEP_S seconds, then the PID
controller engages and the reference steps to STEP_ANGLE_DEG (further
into flexion, i.e. more negative) -- the joint moves to follow it --
printing a status line a few times a second throughout. Logging (and so
the CSV/plots) only covers this last part, starting at the step instant.
On exit the motor is released and:
  - ONE CSV for the run (time_s, dt_s, reference_deg, actual_deg,
    error_deg, p_term_A, i_term_A, d_term_A, current_cmd_A,
    current_clamped, tau_equivalent_Nm, torque_Nm -- one row per control
    tick, every quantity its own column, the step reference alongside
    the measured angle) is saved, so the graphs can be regenerated
    independently later (e.g. in MATLAB);
  - four PNG plots are saved: the step-response plot (reference vs.
    actual, with the hardware limits), the position-error plot, the
    commanded-current plot and the applied-torque plot (k_t * current).

Press Ctrl+C at any time -- the cleanup code still runs, the motor is
released safely, and the CSV/plots (from whatever was logged) are still
produced.
