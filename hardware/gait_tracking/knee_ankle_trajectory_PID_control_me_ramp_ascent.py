knee_ankle_trajectory_PID_control_me_ramp_ascent.py -- 10-degree RAMP ASCENT variant of the combined knee + ankle gait-
trajectory controller that drives BOTH joints with the code-level PID
current-loop position controller tuned in knee_step_test_PID_control_me.py
and ankle_step_test_PID_control_me.py (CubeMars Servo CURRENT LOOP mode,
Control Mode ID 1, actuators.set_torque(), amperes), instead of a single
step. The reference each joint tracks comes from one stride of 10-degree
RAMP ASCENT walking recorded in ramp_acsent_10_degrees/
AB01_incline_walk_2_up10_angle.csv (positions) /
AB01_incline_walk_2_up10_grf.csv (used only to find stride boundaries via
left-foot heel-strike detection, exactly as in the level-walk script
knee_ankle_trajectory_PID_control_me_normal_walk.py, which this script is
derived from -- only the dataset, stride selection and results folder
differ; the control loop, safety guards and logging are unchanged). Same
OpenSim model/column conventions as the level-walk trial, so both
*_DATASET_TO_ENCODER_SIGN values are carried over unchanged.
"_me" = Magnetic Encoder -- exactly like the step-test scripts, this
script relies EXCLUSIVELY on each joint's own external AS5048B magnetic
encoder for feedback; the motor's internal encoder is never read, at all,
for control OR comparison.

CONTROL LAW -- identical to the two step-test scripts, run independently
per joint, every tick (standard discrete PID, backward Euler on the error
for D, forward/rectangular sum for I):

    error_deg[k]  = reference_deg[k] - actual_deg[k]
    integral      += error_deg[k] * dt                    (clamped, anti-windup)
    derivative     = (error_deg[k] - error_deg[k-1]) / dt

    current [A] = KP * error_deg[k] + KI * integral + KD * derivative

reference_deg[k] is no longer a fixed step target -- it comes from a cubic
spline fit through the recorded gait-cycle angle data (Pd(t) below),
exactly the way the reference is generated in
knee_ankle_trajectory_servoPositionControl_me_ie.py. Everything else about
the control law -- units, the PID class, the glitch-jump guard,
ENCODER_TO_MOTOR_SIGN, and the hard/soft safety guards -- is carried over
UNCHANGED from the step-test scripts, per-joint. NO position filtering is
applied to the magnetic-encoder feedback -- actual_deg[k] is the raw
(glitch-guarded) reading, fed straight into the PID every tick.

WHY TWO SEPARATE PID INSTANCES, NOT SHARED GAINS
The knee and ankle were each tuned independently on the bench (see their
own step-test scripts) -- their inertia, leverage, and transmissions
differ, so each joint keeps its own KP/KI/KD, integral clamp, current
clamp, hardware limits, magnetic-encoder calibration (I2C address, offset),
and ENCODER_TO_MOTOR_SIGN below, all copied verbatim from that joint's own
step-test script. Nothing here re-derives or re-tunes those numbers.

TWO MOTORS, ONE CAN BUS, ONE SHARED I2C BUS -- READ THIS FIRST
KNEE_CAN_ID and ANKLE_CAN_ID below are 100 and 1 respectively, matching
the CAN IDs already verified in the two step-test scripts -- verify these
are still correct on the actual bench setup before running. The two
AS5048B magnetic encoders share I2C_BUS but sit at different addresses
(KNEE_AS5048B_ADDR=0x40, ANKLE_AS5048B_ADDR=0x41), also copied verbatim
from the step-test scripts.

SAFETY NOTE -- if EITHER joint's hard limit, tracking-error guard, or I2C
guard fires, BOTH joints stop immediately: an exoskeleton with only one of
its two joints still being actively driven is not a safe state. This
mirrors knee_ankle_trajectory_servoPositionControl_me_ie.py's own
philosophy, adapted to Current Loop Mode.

DATASET SIGN CONVENTION -- READ BEFORE TRUSTING A RUN
KNEE_DATASET_TO_ENCODER_SIGN / ANKLE_DATASET_TO_ENCODER_SIGN below map the
recorded gait angles onto each joint's OWN magnetic-encoder sign
convention as established in that joint's step-test script:
  - Knee: the step-test script's convention is flexion-NEGATIVE (0 deg =
    full extension, more negative = more flexion, hardware limits
    [-110, +1] deg). The raw "knee_angle_l" column in this dataset already
    reads negative during flexion (-67.79 deg to -1.96 deg across the
    whole trial) -- i.e. it already matches this joint's convention
    directly, hence KNEE_DATASET_TO_ENCODER_SIGN = +1.0 (no negation).
    This is the OPPOSITE of what knee_ankle_trajectory_servoPositionControl_me_ie.py
    does with this same column (it negates it) -- that is because that
    script's knee convention is flexion-POSITIVE, a different (older)
    convention than the one verified in knee_step_test_PID_control_me.py,
    which this script's control law is carried over from unchanged.
  - Ankle: the step-test script's convention is "positive = plantar-
    flexion, negative = dorsiflexion", hardware limits [-25, +25] deg.
    ANKLE_DATASET_TO_ENCODER_SIGN = -1.0 here was independently re-derived
    (see conversation history / commit notes) by tracing the actual gait
    pattern against GRF-detected toe-off timing: the dataset's
    "ankle_angle_l" column peaks positive at midstance (dorsiflexion) and
    peaks negative at push-off (plantarflexion) -- i.e. it is
    dorsiflexion-POSITIVE, the opposite of this joint's plantarflexion-
    positive convention, hence the -1.0 flip. Getting this sign wrong
    would make the ankle trajectory play the recorded gait pattern
    mirrored in time (dorsiflexion where the recording shows
    plantarflexion and vice versa) -- NOT a runaway, since the PID still
    tracks whatever the (possibly mirrored) reference is, inside the
    hardware limits and every guard below.
Neither of the above is the same fact as ENCODER_TO_MOTOR_SIGN (whether a
positive commanded current moves actual_deg up or down) -- that one WOULD
be a runaway risk if wrong, and is carried over unchanged and already
verified in each joint's own step-test script.

HOMING (velocity-mode-to-target, identical technique to the step tests) --
SINGLE PHASE, DIRECTLY TO THE TRAJECTORY'S OWN START ANGLE
Both joints are driven, in ONE step, straight from wherever they happen to
be sitting when the script starts to their own dataset-derived trajectory
starting angle -- there is no separate "home to zero/mean position
first" step. Servo Velocity Loop Mode (actuators.set_velocity()) is used,
direction chosen automatically every tick from the live error (see
home_joints() below) -- not a fixed, hand-verified sign -- since the
starting angle depends on the dataset and STRIDE_COUNT, and the joint may
already be sitting on either side of it. Both joints home together,
interleaved in one loop; whichever joint arrives first simply holds
(zero velocity) while it waits for the other to arrive too -- home_joints()
only returns once BOTH have arrived.

TEST SEQUENCE -- the PID controllers are NOT involved until step 3
  1. Home both joints (Velocity Loop Mode), directly and only, to their
     own dataset-derived trajectory starting angle -- home_joints(). A
     joint that arrives before the other waits there for it.
  2. Once both have arrived, settle_before_trajectory() holds both joints
     at that same position (zero velocity, no further driving needed --
     they are already there) for PRE_TRAJ_HOLD_S seconds, so the PID
     controllers don't engage the instant homing stops.
  3. Control HANDS OFF to both PID controllers together, at the same
     instant, and the reference becomes each joint's own
     spline-interpolated gait trajectory, Pd(t), for traj_duration
     seconds. THIS INSTANT IS t=0 for all logging -- the homing and
     settle phases are NOT logged, so the CSV/plots start exactly at the
     handoff, not before it. Each PID's integral/derivative state starts
     completely fresh at this instant.
  4. Motors released. Plots + one CSV per joint saved to
     results/trajectory_PID_knee_ankle_ramp_ascent/run_<N>/ next to this script (N
     increments automatically every run).

Press Ctrl+C at any time -- the cleanup code still runs, both motors are
released safely, and the CSV/plots (from whatever was logged) are still
produced.

PER-JOINT ENABLE SWITCHES -- KNEE_CONTROL / ANKLE_CONTROL
Each is 1 (drive this joint) or 0 (leave it completely alone this run --
no homing, no settling, no PID tracking, its motor is never even woken,
and its magnetic encoder is never read). This lets you bench-tune one
joint's PID gains in isolation without the other joint's motor, sensor,
or CAN registration being touched at all:
  - KNEE_CONTROL=1, ANKLE_CONTROL=0 -- knee only.
  - KNEE_CONTROL=0, ANKLE_CONTROL=1 -- ankle only.
  - Both 1 -- the normal combined knee+ankle run.
  - Both 0 -- nothing moves; the script exits immediately, before opening
    the CAN or I2C buses.
When only one joint is enabled, the CSV/plots for the disabled joint are
simply not produced (the plotting code sizes itself to however many
joints are actually in JOINTS).
